const SEQUENTIAL_THINKING_TOOL: Tool = {
  name: "sequentialthinking",
  description: `A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- Adjust total_thoughts dynamically as you progress
- Question or revise previous thoughts using isRevision and revisesThought
- Branch into alternative approaches with branchFromThought and branchId
- Express uncertainty and explore alternative strategies
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses
- Maintain context through thoughtHistory
- Filter irrelevant information

Parameters explained:
- thought: Current thinking step (e.g., analytical step, revision, hypothesis)
- nextThoughtNeeded: True if more thinking is needed
- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence (must be >= 1)
- totalThoughts: Estimated total thoughts needed (adjustable, must be >= 1)
- isRevision: Boolean indicating if this thought revises a previous one
- revisesThought: Thought number being reconsidered (required if isRevision is true)
- branchFromThought: Thought number from which a new branch starts
- branchId: Identifier for the branch (required if branchFromThought is set)
- needsMoreThoughts: Boolean indicating if more thoughts are needed

Usage guidelines:
1. Start with an initial estimate of totalThoughts
2. Use isRevision/revisesThought to refine failed or suboptimal thoughts
3. Use branchFromThought/branchId to explore alternative strategies
4. Adjust totalThoughts if the task scope changes
5. Express uncertainty and test multiple hypotheses when appropriate
6. Set nextThoughtNeeded to false only when a satisfactory solution is reached

Example API Calls:
- Linear thought:
  {
    "thought": "Start geolocation with Wolfram Alpha",
    "thoughtNumber": 1,
    "totalThoughts": 5,
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true
  }
- Revision:
  {
    "thought": "Revising failed Wolfram Alpha query",
    "thoughtNumber": 3,
    "totalThoughts": 10,
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
    "isRevision": true,
    "revisesThought": 1
  }
- Branching:
  {
    "thought": "Try Google Web Search for coordinates",
    "thoughtNumber": 4,
    "totalThoughts": 10,
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
    "branchFromThought": 3,
    "branchId": "GoogleSearchBranch"
  }
Expected Output:
  {
    "content": [{
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"thoughtNumber\":4,\"totalThoughts\":10,\"nextThoughtNeeded\":true,\"branches\":[\"GoogleSearchBranch\"],\"thoughtHistoryLength\":4,\"suggestion\":null}"
    }]
  }


Common Errors:
- "Invalid thoughtNumber: must be a positive number" - Ensure thoughtNumber is >= 1
- "Missing branchId: must provide branchId when branchFromThought is set" - Include branchId for branching
- "Invalid revisesThought: must be a positive number when isRevision is true" - Provide revisesThought when isRevision is true`,
