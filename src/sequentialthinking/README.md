# Sequential Thinking MCP Server, forked and updated by Grok AI

This fork is much updated toward branching (lateral thinking). See the original for the goal and usage. 

# Explanation: 


### Ideaüí° behind Grok AI's fork proposal

The core of my, Grok AI's, approach here, encouraging revision and branching, is to address the User supplied old version chat log‚Äôs underuse of `isRevision`, `revisesThought`, `branchFromThought`, and `branchId`. Key principles:
- **Suggestions**: Prompt AIs to use revision for failures (e.g., thought 1‚Äôs Wolfram Alpha failure) and branching for alternatives (e.g., thought 3‚Äôs tool switch), countering the log‚Äôs linear progression.
- **Auto-generated `branchId`**: Simplifies branching to encourage exploration of alternative paths (e.g., trying Wikipedia if Google fails), making the tool‚Äôs dynamic capabilities accessible.
- **Robust Documentation**: Guides AIs and developers to use all features, addressing the log‚Äôs missed opportunities for revision and explicit branching.

The refined `index_grok_1.2.ts` strengthens these principles while fixing the identified issues, ensuring compatibility with the MCP framework and encouraging non-linear reasoning.

### Changes Made in `index_grok_1.2.ts`

1. **TypeScript Conversion**:
   - Converted to TypeScript (`index_grok_1.2.ts`) to align with your naming preference and Gemini‚Äôs format.
   - Added explicit interfaces (`ThoughtData`, `ProcessThoughtResponse`) for type safety, ensuring compatibility with the MCP framework.

2. **Deterministic `branchId` Generation**:
   - Replaced `Date.now()` with `Branch_${branchFromThought}_${thoughtNumber}` for deterministic `branchId` values, addressing non-determinism concerns while preserving the proactive branching encouragement.
   - Example: A branch from thought 3 with `thoughtNumber: 4` gets `Branch_3_4`, ensuring traceability.

3. **Refined Suggestion Heuristics**:
   - Added a configurable `enableSuggestions` flag (default: `true` via `ENABLE_SUGGESTIONS` environment variable) to toggle suggestions, balancing proactivity with control.
   - Improved heuristic by checking prior thought history for failures (e.g., `lastThought?.thought.includes('fail')`), reducing false positives (e.g., only suggest revision if the previous thought failed and the current isn‚Äôt a revision).

4. **Enhanced Error Messages**:
   - Included specific values in error messages (e.g., `received ${data.thoughtNumber}`) to pinpoint issues, improving debugging for AIs and developers.

5. **Improved Documentation**:
   - Clarified `needsMoreThoughts`: Added ‚Äúe.g., when task scope expands unexpectedly‚Äù to encourage its use (underused in the log).
   - Added a ‚ÄúParallel branching‚Äù example to illustrate branching for simultaneous queries (e.g., querying Wikipedia alongside Google), aligning with the tool‚Äôs capability for divergent paths.
   - Kept Gemini‚Äôs refined parameter descriptions (e.g., ‚Äúcorrecting, refining, or changing‚Äù for `isRevision`) for clarity.

### Impact on Gemini CLI AI

The refined `index_grok_1.2.ts` addresses the log‚Äôs underuse of `sequentialthinking` features:
- **Revision**: Suggestions prompt `isRevision`/`revisesThought` for failures (e.g., thought 1‚Äôs Wolfram Alpha failure), encouraging Gemini to formalize retries (e.g., thought 2) as revisions.
- **Branching**: Deterministic auto-generated `branchId` simplifies branching, encouraging exploration of alternative paths (e.g., trying Wikipedia after thought 3‚Äôs tool switch), countering the log‚Äôs linear progression in thoughts 5‚Äì14.
- **Uncertainty/Alternatives**: Refined suggestions (considering thought history) encourage expressing uncertainty and testing multiple hypotheses, addressing the log‚Äôs lack of alternative sources.
- **Robustness**: Strict validation and detailed error messages ensure correct usage, guiding Gemini to leverage all features.

The proactive ‚Äúforced branching‚Äù ideology is preserved through suggestions and simplified branching, while fixes (deterministic `branchId`, refined heuristics, TypeScript) address Gemini‚Äôs concerns about non-determinism and over-prompting, ensuring a balance of dynamism and control.
