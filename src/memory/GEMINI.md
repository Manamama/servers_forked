# Debugging the `mcp-server-memory` Toolset

This document is about `mcp-server-memory` toolset, which was found to be non-functional.

## Sequence of Events & Errors

Several tools from the `mcp-server-memory` toolset were tested. Every attempted call failed.

**TUI-Reported Errors:**
The user-facing TUI consistently reported the same error for all attempted operations:
- **Error Message:** `MCP error -32603: Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 88`
- **Affected Tools:** `create_entities`, `read_graph`, `search_nodes`

**Gemini-Reported Errors:**
The raw error output reported to the Gemini agent showed varying positions for the error:
- `create_entities` (with observation): `... at position 88`
- `create_entities` (simple): `... at position 69`
- `search_nodes`: `... at position 34`

## Discrepancy Analysis

The key discrepancy was the difference between the static error position (88) reported by the user's TUI and the variable positions (88, 69, 34) reported to the agent.

- The variable positions reported to the agent correspond directly to the length of the JSON payload for each unique command. This strongly suggests the server was failing at the very end of the input stream.
- The TUI likely captured the first error and displayed it repeatedly, which is a plausible explanation for the consistent "position 88" error message. The additional `API Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'error')` in the TUI log supports the idea that the TUI itself had issues handling the repeated failures.

The `mcp-server-memory` toolset is  broken. The issue is not with the specific tools or the content of the commands, but with the server's core ability to handle or parse incoming requests. The server fails consistently at the end of the data stream, indicating a critical bug in its request handling logic.

## Update: Investigation of the Ineffective Fix

Following the initial analysis, the next step was to determine why the documented fix was not working. The investigation confirmed that the issue is not with the code, but with the environment configuration.

### Summary of Findings

The legacy fix may be wrong. 

1.  **The legacy Fix is in the Source Code:** An analysis of `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/servers_forked/src/memory/index.ts` confirms that the locking mechanism to prevent race conditions is correctly implemented.
2.  **The Code Has Been Compiled:** The presence of the `dist/` directory and the `dist/index.js` file confirms that the corrected TypeScript source code has been successfully compiled into runnable JavaScript.
3.  **Conclusion:** The code itself is suspect.

*For details on the previous debugging that led to the fix, see the files in the `Debug_materials/` directory.*

### Plan for Resolution

The following steps are required to force the environment to use the correct, locally compiled server, which should resolve the `"Unexpected non-whitespace character..."` error.
